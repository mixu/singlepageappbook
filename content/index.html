<p>This free book is what I wanted when I started working with single page apps. It's not an API reference on a particular framework, rather, the focus is on discussing patterns, implementation choices and decent practices.</p>

<p>I'm taking a "code and concepts" approach to the topic -  the best way to learn how to use something is to understand how it is implemented. My ambition here is to decompose the problem of writing a web app, take a fresh look at it and hopefully make better decisions the next time you make one.</p>

<p>Update: the book is now also on <a href="https://github.com/mixu/singlepageappbook">Github</a>. I'll be doing a second set of updates to the book later on. Right now, I'm working a new lightweight open source <a href="http://mixu.net/view.json/">view layer implementation</a>, which has changed and clarified my thinking about the view layer.</p>
